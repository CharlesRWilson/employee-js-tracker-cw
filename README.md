# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

This was a really great project that taught me a lot about functions in JavaScript. I took the starter code that was given to me and turned to website more functional. I added functions to take in user information and then average it out as well as pick a random employee. Doing this helped me to learn about functions and how to write them!

## Usage

To use the site all you have to do is press the button to add a new employee. Once clicked, a prompt will show for the user to put in information about each employee (first name, last name, salary). once entered the information will be stored in a table on the page. If the console log is accessed you will see a random employee picked as wella s the average salary of the employees.
